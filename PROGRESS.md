A task counts only after an independent checker passes it on green CI. Each milestone also ends with the cumulative journey suite green in Chromium and WebKit and a naive-user critic pass.

## Log

- 2026-10-02 — Restart begun. History distilled into docs/history/LEARNINGS.md; PRODUCT.md carried over with restart rulings; ARCHITECTURE.md and BUILDPLAN.md drafted, critiqued by three lenses and revised.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.1 verified: the repo installs as a pnpm workspace, and every push runs CI (plan, checks, build, ci-ok) with lint, single-version, trace and unit checks; a checks-only lane can be dispatched and `minutes.mjs` prints the month's Actions use.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.2 verified: moss@762abb777 (387 files) and @lexical/react 0.48.0's collab plugin (2 files) are vendored verbatim with `ported-from` headers, and every CI run's drift check fails on any byte change or missing header.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.3 verified: the apps/web Worker builds and routes in A§4.1 order with its version stamped into `/api/version` and the page, and `scripts/stack.mjs start` launches a local stack at a clickable `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`; CI smokes the built Worker on every push.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.11 verified: `docs/design/glyphdown-reference.md` indexes 2× light and dark glyphdown@faf98d0 shots of every surface PRODUCT's intro names, plus the vault switcher and suggestions, attached to the M0 PR as the design reference for later triptychs.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.4 verified: the Worker has the D1 schema and email-and-password auth that fails closed on bad secrets, rejects sign-up without `Origin`, rate-limits repeated sign-ins with 429, creates one Home vault per user and serves `/api/me`; two principals can be minted on a local stack.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.9a verified: `e2e/lib` gives journeys actors, principals on a real local stack, telemetry and detectors for invariants 1–9, each proven red by its own selftest fixture, and every e2e run boots the built Worker in the Playwright image for Chromium and WebKit, with a macOS WebKit lane for the `@macos` Backspace legs.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.6 verified: one markdown converter, extracted from pristine moss by `moss-vendor.mjs extract`, runs headless in workerd from `packages/sync`, round-tripping every node family against goldens and the pristine pipeline with deterministic formula ids, no lost lines, and views kept out of its bundle.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.5a verified: the built Worker serves the real moss shell at `/` and `/d/$docId` under a per-request CSP nonce, with moss's root CSS, fonts, theme script and Tailwind config; j00-shell boots two principals cleanly in Chromium and WebKit, light↔dark works through moss Settings, and the parity job compares `shell-default` and `shell-empty` in light and dark against the Ladle oracle.
- 2026-10-02 — T0.6b verified: whole-document markdown import runs with no selection, so a 2 MB note imports in linear time within the DocDO CPU budget (SP2 now fails any import up to 2 MB over 5 s of workerd CPU), while typing and moss paste conversion still move the caret; the new SP2 table is in METHOD.md.
