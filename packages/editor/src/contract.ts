/**
 * @moss-multi/editor: public host contract, API version 1.
 *
 * This file holds types only. The runtime values it describes
 * (`MOSS_EDITOR_API`, `MOSS_EDITOR_INFO`, `mountMossEditor` and the pure host
 * helpers) are exported by `src/index.ts` (frame entry `moss-editor.js`) and
 * `src/host.ts` (host entry `moss-editor-host.js`). The rationale is in
 * docs/design/editor-embed.md. Line references are to brsbl/moss@762abb777,
 * `packages/desktop/src`.
 *
 * Division of labour:
 * - The editor (this package, running in the bb plugin frame) owns every byte
 *   written to a note. It runs moss's own editor at the vendored pin. It also
 *   ports the main-process steps Moss desktop applies on read (editor-read
 *   migrations, the comment-sidecar fallback) and on save (the legacy footer
 *   strip, marker migration, the meta.json rewrite, the folder-rename
 *   decision). It hands the host final file text that matches Moss desktop's
 *   output exactly.
 * - The host (the bb Moss plugin on the Mac) owns paths, its per-note lock,
 *   version checks, lossless verified replacement of files, the folder rename,
 *   exclusive asset creation, change detection, asset serving and retention
 *   of save receipts. It never parses, normalizes, re-encodes or reformats
 *   note files.
 *
 * What API 1 guarantees about concurrent Moss desktop writes:
 * - bb never destroys bytes Moss wrote. Every byte sequence a bb write
 *   displaces is either verified as the expected state, put back, or kept as
 *   a preserved file that is reported to the editor (`MossNoteWrite`).
 * - bb cannot stop Moss from replacing bytes bb wrote. Moss checks its
 *   expected content under an in-process lock and then renames
 *   unconditionally, an unbounded time later, and a Moss window holding
 *   unsaved edits rebases "user wins" on its next save by design. So a bb
 *   save can be replaced by Moss at any later time, including after the
 *   editor has unmounted. API 1 makes such a loss recoverable, not
 *   impossible: every `saved` result and event carries a `receipt` (the exact
 *   bytes saved) that the host retains, and a mounted editor additionally
 *   shows a best-effort notice when a replacement arrives within
 *   `recentSaveGuardMs` of its save. Neither is a detection guarantee.
 *
 * Compatibility rules for API 1:
 * - `MOSS_EDITOR_API` stays `1` for every release that implements this file.
 *   Removing or renaming a field, narrowing a type, or changing a default or a
 *   meaning is a breaking change and requires API 2.
 * - Additive changes keep API 1. They are negotiated by feature strings, not
 *   assumed:
 *   - The editor declares its features in `MOSS_EDITOR_INFO.features`, which
 *     is also published in `editor.json` `features`. A host may return a new
 *     result `kind` or `reason`, or send a new notification `kind`, only if
 *     the editor it mounted lists the feature that introduced it.
 *   - The host declares its features in `MossEditorBridge.features`. The
 *     editor sends a new write op, calls a new optional bridge method, or
 *     relies on a new host behaviour only if the bridge lists the feature that
 *     introduced it.
 *   - The editor adds a new `MossEditorEvent` kind, a new `MossFlushResult`
 *     kind or a new `MossReloadResult` kind only behind a host feature string
 *     the host listed. Hosts may therefore switch exhaustively on every union
 *     in this file.
 *   - API 1's baseline has no feature strings. Everything in this file is
 *     required of both sides unless it is marked optional.
 * - Hosts must ignore unknown event fields and unknown manifest fields. The
 *   editor ignores unknown option fields.
 * - A result `kind` the editor does not know is treated as an error for that
 *   operation, and the edits stay unsaved. Feature negotiation exists so that
 *   this never happens between compliant peers.

 * - `unadopted`: no meta.json, or meta.json `id` fails `isMossNoteId`. Moss

 * - `trashed`: the folder is under `~/Moss/Trash` (`workspaceSegments[0]` is

 *   `Notes/Trash` is an ordinary folder and is editable.

 * - `outsideNotes`: not under `~/Moss/Notes`, for example a loose `.md`

 * - `unreadableMeta`: meta.json exists but is not a JSON object.
 * - `duplicateId`: (host) two folders carry the same `noteIdKey`.
 * - `hostUnsupported`: (host) the host cannot perform the verified
 *   replacement `MossNoteWrite` requires (an atomic exchange of two paths and

 *   skip).
 * - Otherwise `meta` always, plus `markdown` when its bytes differ, OR
 *   `rename` is non-null, OR `location.markdownName` is not
 *   `<location.folderName>.md`. The last case reproduces desktop's
 *   `ensureContentFile`, which every save calls and which moves a legacy
 *   `note.md` or `<id>.md` to `<folderName>.md` (note-store.ts:5116-5148).
 *   Names are compared as strings, as desktop does; because `markdownName`
 *   is the candidate spelling, a case-variant entry (`plan.md` in folder
 *   `Plan`) is not normalized, matching desktop.
 * - `comments` and `layout` puts or deletes when their bytes or presence differ.
 *
 * What the host must do, in order:
 * 1. Take its per-note lock and resolve `noteId` by `noteIdKey`. Return
 *    `notFound` if no folder has it, `notEditable` (`duplicateId`) if two do,
 *    `notEditable` if `noteEditability` refuses it, and `notEditable`
 *    (`hostUnsupported`) if the volume cannot do step 4.
 * 2. Read the current files, resolving the markdown with the two-step
 *    resolution. Compute the content version, each companion's version, and
 *    the meta version. Check, in this order, and write nothing on a
 *    mismatch: content version ≠ `baseVersion` → `conflict` `content`; any
 *    companion version ≠ expected → `conflict` `companion`; meta version ≠
 *    `baseMetaVersion` → `conflict` `meta`. Keep the bytes just read as the
 *    expected state E of every target (absence is a state), and record the
 *    markdown file's `(dev, ino)`.
 * 3. If `rename` is non-null: `allocateFolderName`; if the result equals the
 *    current name, skip. A case-only change on a case-insensitive volume is a
 *    plain `rename(2)`. Otherwise rename the folder exclusively
 *    (`renamex_np(RENAME_EXCL)` or `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`); on EEXIST,
 *    re-list siblings and allocate once more, then return `raced`. The
 *    folder rename is never rolled back. All later paths are in the new
 *    folder.
 * 4. Apply the ops in order markdown, comments, layout, meta, each as a
 *    verified replacement. Temp and holding names come from
 *    `sidecarFileName`. Fsync each temp before it is moved and the folder
 *    after each move; ignore EINVAL, ENOTSUP, EPERM and ENOSYS from fsync.
 *    - put, target present in E: write the temp; atomically exchange temp
 *      and target (`renamex_np(RENAME_SWAP)` or
 *      `renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)`). The temp path now holds the displaced
 *      bytes D. If D = E, keep it as the holding file. If D ≠ E, another
 *      writer landed after step 2: exchange back, then go to step 5.
 *    - put, target absent in E: write the temp; move it to the target
 *      exclusively (`link(2)` then unlink the temp, or `RENAME_EXCL`). On
 *      EEXIST go to step 5.
 *    - delete, target present in E: rename the target to a holding name. If
 *      the held bytes ≠ E, move them back exclusively and go to step 5.
 *    - delete, target absent in E: succeed if it is still absent; otherwise
 *      go to step 5.
 *    - Markdown target and the old file. The put targets
 *      `<folderName>.md` (the final name after step 3). Before the put, the
 *      host `lstat`s that path. If it resolves to the `(dev, ino)` recorded
 *      in step 2, the old file and the target are the same file (a case-only
 *      retitle or a case-variant name on a case-insensitive volume): treat
 *      the target as present in E, exchange onto it, and delete nothing.
 *      After the exchange, if the directory entry's spelling differs from
 *      `<folderName>.md` only in case, rename(2) the entry to that exact
 *      spelling (a same-inode case-only rename replaces no other file).
 *      Only if the old file is a different file from the target does the
 *      host delete it afterwards, as a verified delete. Desktop reaches the
 *      same result by re-resolving after the folder rename and comparing
 *      paths (note-store.ts:5121-5148).
 * 5. On any mismatch (`raced`): roll back every file this write already
 *    replaced, in reverse order, by exchanging its holding file back, but
 *    only where the target still holds this write's bytes. Return
 *    `conflict` `raced`.
 * 6. Re-read every file and recompute both versions. If they differ from the
 *    versions of the bytes this write produced, another writer replaced one
 *    of them after the swap; return `conflict` `raced` with no rollback.
 *    Otherwise remove the holding files, fsync the folder, and return
 *    `saved`. Remember the returned versions so `watch` does not report this
 *    write back.
 *
 * I/O failure at any step after step 2: attempt the step-5 rollback, then
 * return `failed` with the files that still hold this write's bytes in
 * `applied`, every preserved file in `preserved`, and the current
 * `location`. A holding file whose bytes equal E may be removed only after
 * its target is confirmed restored or written; otherwise it is preserved.
 *
 * Lossless invariant: the host never deletes bytes it did not write unless
 * they equal E. Every displaced byte sequence that is not E is either back
 * at its path or kept as a preserved holding file
 * (`.<name>.<uuid>.displaced`) and reported in `preserved` of a `conflict`
 * or `failed` result. The host never deletes preserved files on its own.
 *
 * The host writes `text` as UTF-8 exactly as given, with no BOM added or
 * removed, no newline normalization and no trailing-newline fix-up.
 *
 * Editor rule after `failed`, a rejection or a lost reply: before the next
 * write it re-reads. If each content file on disk equals either its base
 * bytes or the bytes this editor last sent, the disk state is the editor's
 * own: it adopts the new versions as its base and writes the remainder,
 * with no conflict. Any other difference is a `content` conflict.

   *   `refused`, user-visible), unless the disk is its own state (see the
   *   editor rule on `MossNoteWrite`); then it adopts the version silently.
   * - `companion`: refused in step 2 because a companion file the migrated
   *   markdown was built from changed. Nothing written. Desktop detects this
   *   too, because its CAS compares migrated content. The editor enters
   *   `conflict` (cause `refused`, user-visible).
   * - `meta`: refused in step 2 because only meta.json or the location
   *   changed (Moss stamped `lastOpenedAt`, pinned the note, collapsed a
   *   heading, or the folder moved). Nothing written. Not user-visible: the
   *   editor re-reads, re-derives meta.json from the new meta.json text plus
   *   its `MossMetaIntents` and the new location, and retries at once, up to
   *   `metaConflictRetries` times. If the re-read shows a content change, it
   *   is handled as `content`. If retries run out, the editor reports an
   *   `error` event and retries after `errorRetryMs`; it never shows the
   *   conflict banner for meta.
   * - `raced`: another writer changed a file during steps 3-6. `applied`
   *   lists the files that still hold this write's bytes after rollback
   *   (usually empty for step-5 races). `preserved` lists displaced bytes the
   *   host kept. The editor enters `conflict` (cause `refused`), and the user
   *   chooses Reload, Keep editing or Overwrite.
